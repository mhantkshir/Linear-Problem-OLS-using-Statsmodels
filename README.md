# Linear-Problem-OLS-using-Statsmodels
## Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is a method that allows us to find a line that best describes the relationship between one or more predictor variables and a response variable.

**This method allows us to find the following equation:**

>ŷ = b0 + b1x

>where:

- ŷ: The estimated response value
- b0: The intercept of the regression line
- b1: The slope of the regression line

**This equation can help us understand the relationship between the predictor and response variable, and it can be used to predict the value of a response variable given the value of the predictor variable.**

**Conclusion**
>Score Achieved OLS Statsmodels :
R-squared (uncentered): 0.993
Adj. R-squared (uncentered): 0.992

>Score Achieved Linear Regression :
R2 score for test is 0.9520086347128638
Adjusted R2 for test is 0.923213815540582

- Score achieved through OLS method is better than Linear Regression model.
